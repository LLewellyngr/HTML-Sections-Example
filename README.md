# HTML Sections Example

This is a simple webpage that demonstrates the usage of HTML sections to create different sections with unique content. The page is designed using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap 5.3.0-alpha2

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure and content of the webpage.
- `style/style.css`: The custom CSS file that defines additional styles for the page.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Sections

The webpage consists of three sections, each with its own unique content and styling:

1. Section 1: This section has a light blue background and displays the heading "Section 1." It demonstrates the usage of the `section` element and the `id` attribute to create a specific section within the page.

2. Section 2: This section has a grey background and displays the heading "Section 2." It follows the same structure as Section 1, with a different background color.

3. Section 3: This section has a light green background and displays the heading "Section 3." It also follows the same structure as the previous sections, showcasing the flexibility of creating multiple sections within a webpage.

## Navigation

The webpage includes a fixed-top navigation bar implemented using the Bootstrap framework. The navigation bar includes links to each section, allowing users to easily navigate to a specific section by clicking on the corresponding link.

## Styling

The page utilizes Bootstrap classes for the navigation bar and custom CSS rules for additional styling. The `hero` class is applied to each section container to vertically align the content in the center and set its height to occupy the full viewport height.
